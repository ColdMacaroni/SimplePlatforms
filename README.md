The ecs100 library... wow. I'm putting all my pygame experience into this. My collision system is like *completely* cringefail, but that's never stopped anyone.

Just like compile it and the run main :D. You do need the ecs100.jar library to run this. I am not distributing it because I do not want to deal with all that licensing stuff. I used IntelliJ hope that helps
